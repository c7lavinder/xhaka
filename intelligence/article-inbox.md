# How to Become an AI Engineer in 6 Months
Source: pasted
Submitted: 2026-03-14
Tags: #ai-strategy #engineering #roadmap

## Content
Month 1: Python, Git, CLI, JSON/APIs/HTTP/async, SQL, pandas, FastAPI/Flask
Month 2: LLM fundamentals — prompting, system/user instructions, structured outputs, tool calling, streaming, conversation state, cost/latency/tokens, failure handling, prompt injection
Month 3: RAG — embeddings, chunking, vector DBs, metadata filtering, reranking, hallucination reduction, citations
Month 4: Agents — agent loops, tool selection, state management, retries, when NOT to use agents, evals, task success metrics
Month 5: Deployment — FastAPI prod patterns, Docker, background jobs, queues, auth, logging, observability, prompt versioning, cost monitoring, caching
Month 6: Specialize — choose Direction 1 (AI product engineer: LLM apps/RAG/agents/deployment), Direction 2 (Applied ML: fine-tuning/evals/open-source), or Direction 3 (AI automation: workflow orchestration/business process/multi-tool systems/CRM/ops)

Key principle: learn each topic then immediately test in real work. By month 6 you'll have built products you can show.

# Manus RAG Build Prompt — Gunner AI Platform

## Content
Task: Build RAG system into Gunner AI platform (MANUS-Gunner-AI repo).

4 data sources needed:
1. Call library — embed all graded calls >60s so AI can reference real NAH examples when coaching
2. Coach conversation memory — embed every Q&A so AI builds on past answers
3. Team action tracking — track whether team completed/dismissed/modified AI-suggested tasks
4. Conversion intelligence — analyze which call behaviors correlate with closed deals, inject patterns into coaching prompts

Technical: TiDB/MySQL (no pgvector), store embeddings as JSON text, cosine similarity in JS, OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dims), everything tenant-scoped.

Success: AI coach auto-retrieves 3 similar past calls + 2 prior answers when responding, conversion patterns visible in coaching system, backfill script for historical calls.
